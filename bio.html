  <p>Salvador Salgado's food truck business has been around since the 1970's. His grandfather
  has passed down the business to his father and on to his son. They have been praised by using only the
  finest ingredients and have always looked onto the future for better and faster methods of obtaining them.
  This family owned business has thrived in the city of Los Angeles by not only providing food for the
  their customers, but for their community as well. By creating sponsorships and donating funds to local parks and schools,
  they have created a movement to bring people together and clean up the area. This Carribean based food truck has served many from
  different backgrounds. Until Salvador is no longer able, he hopes his children can keep the business running and continue the Salgado legacy prime.</p>
